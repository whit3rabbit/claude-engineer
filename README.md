## ✨ Features

- 💬 Interactive chat interface with Claude-3.5-Sonnet
- 📁 File system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)
- 🔍 Web search capabilities using Tavily API
- 🌈 Syntax highlighting for code snippets
- 🏗️ Project structure creation and management
- 🧐 Code analysis and improvement suggestions
- 🖼️ Vision capabilities support via drag and drop of images in the terminal
- 🚀 Automode for autonomous task completion
- 🔄 Iteration tracking in automode

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Doriandarko/claude-engineer.git
   cd claude-engineer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Add your Anthropic and Tavily API keys at the start of the file:
     ```python
     client = Anthropic(api_key="YOUR API KEY")
     tavily = TavilyClient(api_key="YOUR API KEY")
     ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the main script to start the Claude Engineer interface:

```
python main.py
```

Once started, you can interact with Claude Engineer by typing your queries or commands. Some example interactions:

- "Create a new Python project structure for a web application"
- "Explain the code in file.py and suggest improvements"
- "Search for the latest best practices in React development"
- "Help me debug this error: [paste your error message]"

Special commands:
- Type 'exit' to end the conversation and close the application.
- Type 'image' to include an image in your message.
- Type 'automode' plus the max amount of iterations to enter Autonomous mode.
- Press Ctrl+C at any time to exit the automode to return to regular chat.

### 🤖 Automode

Automode allows Claude to work autonomously on complex tasks. When in automode:

1. Claude sets clear, achievable goals based on your request.
2. It works through these goals one by one, using available tools as needed.
3. Claude provides regular updates on its progress.
4. Automode continues until goals are completed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

To use automode:
1. Type 'automode' when prompted for input.
2. Provide your request when prompted.
3. Claude will work autonomously, providing updates after each iteration.
4. Automode exits when the task is completed or after reaching the maximum number of iterations.

Note: Claude will only have access to the files in the root folders of the script or any folder path you provide it.
